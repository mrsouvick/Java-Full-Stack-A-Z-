# 🚀 Java Full Stack Journey – From Basics to Advanced  

Welcome to my **Java Full Stack Development Journey**! 🌟  
This repository contains all the **codes, notes, and projects** I’ll be writing as I learn and grow from **Java fundamentals → backend → frontend → full-stack applications**.

## 📚 What’s Inside  
✅ **Core Java** – OOP, Collections, Multithreading, Exception Handling, etc.  
✅ **Advanced Java** – JDBC, Servlets, JSP  
✅ **Spring Framework & Spring Boot** – REST APIs, Dependency Injection, Security  
✅ **Databases** – MySQL, MongoDB (with CRUD operations)  
✅ **Frontend** – HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React basics  
✅ **Full Stack Projects** – End-to-End Applications

## 🎯 Goal  
- Build a **solid foundation in Java**  
- Learn **modern frameworks & tools** used in industry  
- Create **real-world projects** step by step  
- Share everything openly so others can **learn along with me**
